        <p>My career plans include graduating from high school with honours and going to university. I donâ€™t have an exact idea of what I want my future to look like but I know I am interested in Maths and Sciences. Helping people is something I am passionate about so a career in medicine has always been of interest to me. I hope to narrow down my options once the science class taught at Queen E splits into biology, chemistry, and physics. </p>
